once upon a time there was a hare . that was fast. and there was a turtle , who was teased by everyone in the forest for being slow.
so the turtle challenged the hare. the race started and the hare ran fast. turtle was going slowly. the hare went a little distance
from the finish line. it thought the turtle will only reach after a long time, so the hare took a nap. but the turtle kept walking
without taking rest. as the hare was taking a nap, the turtle reached the finish line before the hare. THE END.

Moral:hare is a good boy
